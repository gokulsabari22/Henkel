The evidence from human as well as animal studies was\\\\nevaluated by IARC as insufficient to classify fiberglass continuous filament as a possible, probable, or confirmed cancer\\\\ncausing material. This conclusion was confirmed by IARC in October 2001.\\\\n\\\\nThe American Conference of Govemmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) A4 classification, not classifiable as a human\\\\n\\\\ncarcinogen, for Respirable continuous filament glass fibers is based on inadequate data in terms of its Carcinogenicity in\\\\nhumans and/or animals.\\\\n\\\\nFor Respirable continuous filament glass fibers, a TLV-TWA of 1 fiber/cc was adopted to protect workers against\\\\n\\\\nmechanical irritation. The TLV-TWA of 5 mg/m3 was adopted for nonrespirable glass filament fiber, measured as\\\\ninhalable dust, to prevent mechanical irritation of the upper respiratory tract.\\\\n\\\\nNote: There are no known chronic health effects connected with long term use or contact with these products.\\\\n\\\\nProducts that are chopped, crushed or severely mechanically processed during manufacture or use may contain a very\\\\nsmall amount of Respirable glass fiber-like fragments. Persistent Respirable glass fibers are suspected to cause cancer.\\\\n\\\\nNIOSH defines \\\\u201cRespirable fibers \\\\u201c as greater than 5 microns in length and less than 3 microns in diameter with an aspect\\\\nratio of > 5:1(length-to-width ratio).\\\\n\\\\nComponent Carcinogenicity\\\\n\\\\nFiber Glass (crushed/shredded continuous filament) (65997 -17-3)\\\\n\\\\nACGIH: A4-\\\\u2014 Not classifiable as a human carcinogen.

The product\\\\noffers a unique formulating option for composites, coatings, and adhesives. When used for epoxy resin curing, this\\\\namine can provide synergistic processing and cured resin performance advantages relative to simple mixtures of\\\\npolyetheramines and cycloaliphatic amines.\"\\n\"HUNTSMAN\\\\n\\\\nEnriching lives through innovation\\\\n\\\\nJEFFAMINE\\\\u00ae RFD 270 amine can be used as an epoxy curing agent in composite applications such as wind\\\\nturbine rotor blades, coatings, and other applications, polyamides and polyureas. One of the benefits of this\\\\nmaterial is its higher glass transition temperature capability for epoxy curing agent applications.\\\\n\\\\nXTJ-616\\\\n\\\\nXTJ-616 is a predominantly tetrafunctional, primary amine with an average molecular weight of about 660. The\\\\nprimary amine groups are located on secondary carbon atoms near the ends of the aliphatic polyether chains.\\\\n\\\\nXTJ-616 provides tough, clear, impact resistant coatings, castings, and adhesives and improves nylon shear-\\\\nthinning properties. Other benefits are low vapor pressure and inhibited \\\\u201camine blush\\\\u201d formation in epoxy systems.\\\\n\\\\nAverage\\\\nExperimental Products AHEW, Applications and Benefits\\\\n\\\\nele\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u00a2 Faster curing and property development, allowing reduction of\\\\n\\\\nany accelerator usage\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u00a2 Low viscosity, color and vapor pressure\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u00a2 Lower blushing or carbamation (reaction with atmospheric\\\\n\\\\ncarbon dioxide) compared to cycloaliphatic amines\\\\nJEFFAMINE\\\\u00ae RFD-270 amine \\\\u00a2 Faster strength development than PEA curatives and\\\\n\\\\nexcellent mechanical properties\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u00a2 Potential cost savings when formulated with JEFFSOL\\\\u00ae PC\\\\ncarbonate-diluted resin vs. aliphatic epoxy-diluted resin\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u00a2 Improved chemical resistance to typical acids and bases in\\\\ncoating applications.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\u00a2 Curing agent for epoxy resins\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u00a2 Reacts quickly with isocyanates, increasing crosslinking in\\\\nXTJ-616 83 polyurea systems\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u00a2 Salts may be readily formed for use in surfactants\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u00a2 Co-monomer in nylons\\\\n\\\\nOleophilic Monoamines\\\\n\\\\nXTJ-435 and XTJ-436 are monofunctional amines similar to the JEFFAMINE\\\\u00ae M series products. These products\\\\nare more oleophilic than the equivalent M series products and not water soluble.\\\\n\\\\nXTJ-435 Chemical Intermediate\\\\n\\\\nXTJ-435 is a monoamine derived from a modified fatty alcohol. Due to a regulatory restriction, XTJ-435 may be\\\\nused only as a chemical intermediate.\"\\n\"HUNTSMAN\\\\n\\\\nEnriching lives through innovation\\\\n\\\\nXTJ-436\\\\nXTJ-436 is a 1000 molecular weight monoamine which contains an aromatic segment.\\\\n\\\\nThe hydrophobic nature of this amine makes it especially useful for oil- or solvent-based systems. The product\\\\nfinds application in emulsifiers and corrosion inhibitors.\\\\n\\\\nHigher Conversion Amines\\\\n\\\\nProcesses have been developed to increase conversion to primary amines for several of the core JEFFAMINE\\\\u00ae\\\\npolyetheramines. Two such products are currently available: a high conversion 440 molecular weight diamine\\\\n(XTJ-582), and a high conversion 2000 molecular weight diamine (XTJ-578). The higher functionality and\\\\nconversion are beneficial in polymerizations such as polyamide formation.\\\\n\\\\nSTORAGE AND HANDLING\\\\n\\\\nMaterials of Construction\\\\nAt temperatures of 75-100\\\\u00b0F (24-38\\\\u00b0C)\\\\n\\\\nTanks Carbon steel\\\\n\\\\nLines, valves Carbon steel\\\\n\\\\nPumps Carbon steel\\\\n\\\\nHeat exchange Surfaces Stainless steel\\\\n\\\\nHoses Stainless steel, polyethylene, polypropylene, TEFLON\\\\u00ae\\\\n\\\\nPolypropylene or TEFLON\\\\u00ae (elastomers such as neoprene, Buna N,\\\\nand VITON\\\\u00ae should be avoided).\\\\nAtmosphere Nitrogen or dry air\\\\n\\\\nAt temperatures above 100\\\\u00b0F (38\\\\u00b0C)\\\\n\\\\nTanks Stainless steel\\\\n\\\\nLines, Valves Stainless steel\\\\n\\\\nPumps Stainless steel or Carpenter 20 equivalent\\\\nAtmosphere Nitrogen\\\\n\\\\nJEFFAMINE\\\\u00ae polyetheramines may be stored under air at ambient temperatures for extended periods.
